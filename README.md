Simple GUI Calculator
By John Waugh

I wanted to improve on a calculator which I was tasked with making for a lab assignment in college. Features that have been added include buttons for numbers 0-9, for basic mathmatical operations, for raising numbers to the power of 2 and also taking the square root of numbers in the textfield, and a decimal button. I have also added a little color to the calculator, including gradient buttons. 

It works similarly to a calculator application on a phone, except when entering in your expression you would want to format it as an infix expression. You enter in your expression and it prints out the result.

Possible improvements could include:
- Fixing errors surrounding the decimal button, which sometimes crashes the class which evaluates the expression. 
- Fixing certain really long expression that include all of the mathematical operators seem to crash the calculator, so I will probably have to look into improving the expression evaluator to account for more cases.
- Allowing the calculator to have results that are negative numbers, which as of 6/20/2023, it crashes when the result is negative.
